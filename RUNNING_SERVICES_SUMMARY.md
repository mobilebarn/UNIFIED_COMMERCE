## Testing Access
You can now test the complete Retail OS platform:

1. **Storefront**: Visit http://localhost:3000 to browse the e-commerce storefront

3. **GraphQL API**: Visit http://localhost:4000/graphql to query all services through the unified GraphQL API
4. **Infrastructure Monitoring**:
   - Grafana Dashboard: http://localhost:3001
   - Jaeger Tracing: http://localhost:16686
   - Prometheus Metrics: http://localhost:9090

## Next Steps
1. Test the GraphQL queries across all connected services
2. Verify cross-service relationships and federated queries
3. Test the storefront functionality (browsing, cart, checkout)
4. Test the admin panel functionality (product management, order management)
5. Monitor performance and optimize as needed
