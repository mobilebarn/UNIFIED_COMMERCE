## 🔧 Issues Identified

### Port Conflicts
Multiple services are failing to start due to port binding errors:
- "listen tcp :8005: bind: Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted."
- "listen tcp :8003: bind: Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted."

This indicates that services are already running on these ports, but the PowerShell script is trying to start new instances.

### Missing Services
Five services are not responding to health checks:
- Identity Service (8001)
- Cart Service (8002)
- Product Catalog Service (8006)
- Promotions Service (8007)
- Merchant Account Service (8008)

## 🎯 Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Resolve Port Conflicts**
   - Identify and stop duplicate service instances
   - Ensure each service runs on its designated port only

2. **Start Missing Services**
   - Start Identity Service (8001)
   - Start Cart Service (8002)
   - Start Product Catalog Service (8006)
   - Start Promotions Service (8007)
   - Start Merchant Account Service (8008)

3. **Verify GraphQL Federation**
   - Confirm all running services are properly federated
   - Test cross-service queries
   - Update gateway configuration if needed

### Longer-term Goals
1. Connect admin panel to GraphQL Federation Gateway
2. Begin Next.js storefront development
3. Enhance React admin panel functionality
4. Set up Kubernetes deployment manifests
5. Implement CI/CD pipelines
