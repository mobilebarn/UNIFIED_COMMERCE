# Unified Commerce Platform

A next-generation commerce operating system that truly unifies online and offline retail operations through a modern microservices architecture.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

This platform is built as a **Unified Commerce Operating System** that combines:
- **Best-in-class headless storefront capabilities** (surpassing Shopify's flexibility)
- **Deeply integrated business management ecosystem** (following Square's model)
- **Real-time data synchronization** across all channels and touchpoints

### Core Principles
- **Pure microservices architecture** for maximum scalability and flexibility
- **Database-per-service** pattern with polyglot persistence
- **GraphQL Federation Gateway** for unified API access
- **Headless-first design** for ultimate creative control
- **Cloud-native deployment** on Kubernetes (GKE)

## 🎯 Phase 1 Goals (Core Commerce Engine)

1. **Core Microservices**: Identity, Merchant Accounts, Product Catalog, Inventory, Orders
2. **GraphQL Federation Gateway**: Unified API layer
3. **Headless Storefront**: Next.js with SSR/SSG
4. **Kubernetes Infrastructure**: GKE deployment ready
5. **CI/CD Pipelines**: Automated testing and deployment

## 🚀 Technology Stack

| Component | Technology | Rationale |
|-----------|------------|-----------|
| **Backend Services** | Go (Golang) | Superior performance, native concurrency, simple deployment |
| **API Gateway** | GraphQL Federation | Single endpoint, efficient data fetching, type safety |
| **Storefront** | Next.js (React) | Excellent performance via SSR/SSG, SEO optimization |
| **Admin Panel** | React | Proven scalability for complex UIs, rich ecosystem |
| **Databases** | PostgreSQL, MongoDB | ACID compliance + flexible document storage |
| **Search** | Elasticsearch | Powerful full-text search and analytics |
| **Cache/Store** | Redis | High-speed caching and real-time operations |
| **Message Queue** | Apache Kafka | Reliable event-driven communication |
| **Container Platform** | Kubernetes (GKE) | Industry-standard orchestration |
