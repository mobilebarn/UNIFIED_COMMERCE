# CI/CD Pipeline Implementation Guide for Retail OS

## Overview
This document provides instructions for implementing and configuring CI/CD pipelines for Retail OS. The pipeline automates testing, building, and deployment of all platform components including microservices, frontend applications, and infrastructure.

## Pipeline Architecture
The CI/CD system consists of three main workflow categories:

### 1. Go Services Pipeline
Handles building, testing, and deploying the 8 Go microservices:
- Identity Service
- Merchant Account Service
- Product Catalog Service
- Inventory Service
- Order Service
- Cart Service
- Payment Service
- Promotions Service

### 2. Frontend Pipeline
Handles building, testing, and deploying frontend applications:
- Storefront (Next.js)
- Admin Panel (React/Vite)
- GraphQL Gateway (Node.js)

### 3. Infrastructure Pipeline
Handles validation and deployment of infrastructure:
- Docker Compose configurations
- Kubernetes manifests
- Environment deployments

## Prerequisites
- GitHub repository
- Docker Hub account (or alternative container registry)
- Kubernetes clusters for staging and production
- Slack workspace (for notifications)

## GitHub Actions Workflows

### Go Services Workflow (.github/workflows/go-services.yml)
Triggers on changes to:
- `services/**`
- `shared/**`
- `go.mod`
- `go.sum`

#### Jobs:
1. **Test**: Runs unit tests and linters for each service
2. **Build**: Compiles binaries for each service
3. **Docker Build**: Creates and pushes Docker images

### Frontend Workflow (.github/workflows/frontend.yml)
Triggers on changes to:
- `storefront/**`
- `admin-panel-new/**`
- `gateway/**`

#### Jobs:
1. **Storefront**: Tests and builds the storefront application
2. **Admin Panel**: Tests and builds the admin panel application
3. **Gateway**: Tests and builds the GraphQL gateway
4. **Docker Build**: Creates and pushes Docker images for frontend apps

### Infrastructure Workflow (.github/workflows/infrastructure.yml)
Triggers on changes to:
- `docker-compose.yml`
- `docker-compose.services.yml`
- `k8s/**`

#### Jobs:
1. **Validate**: Validates Docker Compose and Kubernetes configurations
2. **Deploy Staging**: Deploys to staging environment (develop branch)
3. **Deploy Production**: Deploys to production environment (main branch)

## Configuration

### Secrets Required
Set the following secrets in GitHub repository settings:
- `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME`: Docker Hub username
- `DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`: Docker Hub access token
- `STAGING_KUBECONFIG`: Staging Kubernetes cluster configuration
- `PRODUCTION_KUBECONFIG`: Production Kubernetes cluster configuration
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`: Slack webhook for deployment notifications

### Environment Variables
The workflows use the following environment variables:
- Branch-based deployment (main → production, develop → staging)
- Docker image tagging based on Git metadata
- Container registry configuration

## Pipeline Stages

### 1. Continuous Integration (CI)

#### Code Checkout
- Uses `actions/checkout@v3` to fetch repository code
- Supports both push and pull request events

#### Dependency Management
- Caches Go modules for faster builds
- Caches Node.js dependencies using lock files
- Ensures consistent dependency versions

#### Testing
- Unit tests for Go services using `go test`
- Linting for Go services using `go vet`
- Unit tests for frontend applications using framework-specific test runners
- Linting for frontend applications using ESLint/TSLint

#### Security Scanning
- Static code analysis
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Container image scanning

### 2. Continuous Delivery (CD)

#### Building
- Compiles Go services into binaries
- Builds frontend applications (Next.js, Vite, Node.js)
- Creates optimized production builds

#### Containerization
- Multi-stage Docker builds for minimal image sizes
- Automated tagging based on Git metadata
- Pushes images to container registry

#### Artifact Storage
- Stores build artifacts using GitHub Actions artifacts
- Preserves binaries and build outputs for deployment

### 3. Continuous Deployment

#### Environment Validation
- Validates Docker Compose configurations
- Validates Kubernetes manifests
- Checks for configuration errors before deployment

#### Deployment Strategies
- **Staging**: Automatic deployment on develop branch pushes
- **Production**: Automatic deployment on main branch pushes
- Supports blue-green and rolling update strategies

#### Health Checks
- Verifies service availability after deployment
- Runs smoke tests to ensure functionality
- Monitors application health

#### Rollback Procedures
- Automated rollback on deployment failure
- Manual rollback capabilities
- Version tracking for all deployments

## Monitoring and Notifications

### Slack Integration
- Deployment success notifications
- Deployment failure alerts
- Environment status updates

### GitHub Checks
- Status checks for pull requests
- Detailed logs and artifacts
- Test coverage reporting

## Security Considerations

### Secret Management
- Uses GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
- Never stores secrets in code
- Rotates credentials regularly

### Access Control
- Role-based access to deployment environments
- Approval requirements for production deployments
- Audit logging for all deployment activities

### Vulnerability Scanning
- Scans dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- Scans container images for security issues
- Integrates with security scanning tools

## Performance Optimization

### Caching
- Caches dependencies between workflow runs
- Caches Docker layers for faster builds
- Uses build matrices for parallel execution

### Parallelization
- Runs tests for different services in parallel
- Builds multiple Docker images concurrently
- Deploys frontend applications in parallel

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- Go services: `go test` with coverage reporting
- Frontend: Jest, React Testing Library, etc.
- Infrastructure: Configuration validation

### Integration Testing
- Service-to-service communication tests
- Database integration tests
- API contract testing

### End-to-End Testing
- UI testing for frontend applications
- User flow testing
- Performance testing

## Deployment Environments

### Development
- Feature branch deployments
- Automated testing
- Developer self-service deployments

### Staging
- Pre-production environment
- Mirror of production configuration
- Automated deployments from develop branch

### Production
- Live customer-facing environment
- Manual approval for critical changes
- Automated deployments from main branch

## Rollback and Recovery

### Automated Rollback
- Triggers on deployment failure
- Reverts to previous known good version
- Notifies team of rollback actions

### Manual Rollback
- CLI-based rollback procedures
- Web interface for rollback operations
- Version history tracking

### Disaster Recovery
- Backup and restore procedures
- Multi-region deployment strategies
- Business continuity planning

## Monitoring and Observability

### Deployment Metrics
- Deployment frequency
- Lead time for changes
- Mean time to recovery
- Change failure rate

### Application Metrics
- Service uptime
- Response times
- Error rates
- Resource utilization

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Build failures**: Check dependency versions and code changes
2. **Test failures**: Review test logs and recent code changes
3. **Deployment failures**: Check environment configuration and permissions
4. **Docker build failures**: Verify Dockerfile syntax and base images

### Debugging Commands
```bash
# Run tests locally
cd services/identity && go test -v ./...

# Validate Kubernetes manifests
kubectl apply --dry-run=client -f k8s/manifests/ -R

# Check workflow logs
gh run list
gh run view <run-id>
```
