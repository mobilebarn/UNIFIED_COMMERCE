# UNIFIED COMMERCE PLATFORM - PROJECT STATUS SUMMARY

## üìÖ Date: September 7, 2025

## üéØ Executive Summary

We have successfully completed the core backend infrastructure of the Unified Commerce Platform, with all 8 microservices properly connected to the GraphQL Federation Gateway. The frontend applications (admin panel and storefront) are running but still using mock data. Our next focus is to connect these frontend applications to the GraphQL Federation Gateway to display real data.

## ‚úÖ Major Accomplishments

### 1. Infrastructure & DevOps
- ‚úÖ Docker containers for PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and Kafka are running
- ‚úÖ All required infrastructure services operational and accessible
- ‚úÖ Docker configurations created for all services and applications

### 2. Backend Microservices
- ‚úÖ All 8 microservices implemented with complete functionality:
  - Identity Service (8001) - Authentication and user management
  - Cart Service (8002) - Shopping cart functionality
  - Order Service (8003) - Order management
  - Payment Service (8004) - Payment processing
  - Inventory Service (8005) - Inventory tracking
  - Product Catalog Service (8006) - Product information
  - Promotions Service (8007) - Discounts and promotions
  - Merchant Account Service (8008) - Merchant profiles and subscriptions
- ‚úÖ All services building successfully with `go build`
- ‚úÖ All 8 services responding to health checks

### 3. GraphQL Federation Implementation
- ‚úÖ Apollo Federation v2 implementation in place
- ‚úÖ Federation directives properly configured
- ‚úÖ Shared types defined with @key directives
- ‚úÖ **ALL 8 SERVICES SUCCESSFULLY CONNECTED TO FEDERATION GATEWAY** ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Gateway running on http://localhost:4000/graphql
- ‚úÖ Cross-service queries working correctly across all services

### 4. Frontend Applications
- ‚úÖ Admin panel UI complete and running on http://localhost:3002
- ‚úÖ Authentication UI implemented
- ‚úÖ Storefront UI complete and running on http://localhost:3000
- ‚è≥ Both applications using mock data instead of real GraphQL data

## üîß Current Technical Status

### GraphQL Federation Gateway
**Status:** COMPLETE ‚úÖ
- Running on `http://localhost:4000/graphql`
- All 8 services successfully federated
- Cross-service relationships established
- Health check endpoint at `/health`
- GraphQL Playground available at `/graphql`

### Service Health Checks
All services responding successfully:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8001/health  # Identity Service
curl http://localhost:8002/health  # Cart Service
curl http://localhost:8003/health  # Order Service
curl http://localhost:8004/health  # Payment Service
curl http://localhost:8005/health  # Inventory Service
curl http://localhost:8006/health  # Product Catalog Service
curl http://localhost:8007/health  # Promotions Service
curl http://localhost:8008/health  # Merchant Account Service
```

### Frontend Applications
