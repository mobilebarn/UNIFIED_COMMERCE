# üöÄ Retail OS Railway CLI Deployment Guide

## Current Status ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ Railway CLI installed and authenticated
- ‚úÖ Project created: `retail-os-platform`
- ‚úÖ Databases provisioned: PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB

## Manual CLI Deployment Process

Since Railway CLI requires interactive input, follow these steps for each service:

### üîÑ For Each Service (Repeat 12 times)

#### Step 1: Navigate to Service Directory
```powershell
cd services/identity  # Replace with each service path
```

#### Step 2: Deploy and Create Service
```powershell
railway up
```

**When prompted:**
1. **"Select a service"** ‚Üí Choose **"Create new service"** (should be an option)
2. **"Service name"** ‚Üí Enter: `retail-os-identity` (replace with appropriate name)
3. **Wait for deployment** ‚Üí CLI will build and deploy automatically

#### Step 3: Set Environment Variables
```powershell
# For Identity Service
railway variables set SERVICE_NAME=identity
railway variables set ENVIRONMENT=production
railway variables set JWT_SECRET=prod-secure-jwt-secret-identity-2024
railway variables set JWT_EXPIRATION=86400
railway variables set LOG_LEVEL=info

# Database variables will be auto-linked by Railway
```

#### Step 4: Verify Deployment
```powershell
railway status
railway logs
```

## üîó Post-Deployment: Update Service URLs

After all backend services are deployed, update the Gateway with service URLs:

```powershell
cd gateway
railway variables set IDENTITY_SERVICE_URL=https://retail-os-identity.railway.app
railway variables set MERCHANT_SERVICE_URL=https://retail-os-merchant.railway.app
railway variables set PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL=https://retail-os-product.railway.app
railway variables set INVENTORY_SERVICE_URL=https://retail-os-inventory.railway.app
railway variables set ORDER_SERVICE_URL=https://retail-os-order.railway.app
railway variables set PAYMENT_SERVICE_URL=https://retail-os-payment.railway.app
railway variables set CART_SERVICE_URL=https://retail-os-cart.railway.app
railway variables set PROMOTIONS_SERVICE_URL=https://retail-os-promotions.railway.app
railway variables set ANALYTICS_SERVICE_URL=https://retail-os-analytics.railway.app

# Redeploy gateway with new URLs
railway up
cd ..
```

## üéØ Expected Results

After deployment, your Retail OS platform will be available at:

- **üè™ Storefront**: `https://retail-os-storefront.railway.app`
- **‚öôÔ∏è Admin Panel**: `https://retail-os-admin.railway.app`  
- **üîó GraphQL Gateway**: `https://retail-os-gateway.railway.app/graphql`
- **üìä Railway Dashboard**: https://railway.com/project/1f76e4aa-b36a-4670-a445-1bfde6bba0a3

## üìù Deployment Notes

- **Database Connections**: Railway automatically provides database URLs via environment variables
- **Service Discovery**: Update Gateway URLs after all backend services are deployed
- **Port Configuration**: Payment service uses port 8005 (important for avoiding conflicts)
- **Security**: All services use production JWT secrets
- **Monitoring**: Use `railway logs` to monitor deployment progress

## üöÄ Quick Start Command

Start with the first service:
```powershell
cd services/identity
railway up
```

Then follow the interactive prompts to create "retail-os-identity" service.
