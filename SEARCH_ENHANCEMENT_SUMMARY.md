## Overview
This document summarizes the implementation of search enhancements with autocomplete and suggestions for the Unified Commerce storefront.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Backend GraphQL Schema Updates
- Added `SearchSuggestion` type to the product catalog GraphQL schema
- Added `searchSuggestions` query to retrieve autocomplete suggestions
- Defined `SearchSuggestionType` enum with values: PRODUCT, CATEGORY, BRAND

### 2. Frontend Implementation
- Created custom `useSearchSuggestions` hook for fetching search suggestions
- Enhanced Navigation component with autocomplete functionality
- Added search suggestions dropdown for both desktop and mobile views
- Implemented search form submission handling
- Added click-outside detection to close suggestions dropdown

### 3. User Experience Improvements
- Real-time search suggestions as users type
- Visual distinction between product, category, and brand suggestions
- Product images displayed in suggestions when available
- Keyboard navigation support through form submission
- Loading states for better user feedback

## Technical Details

### GraphQL Schema Changes
```graphql
type SearchSuggestion {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  type: SearchSuggestionType!
  imageUrl: String
}

enum SearchSuggestionType {
  PRODUCT
  CATEGORY
  BRAND
}

type Query {
  # ... existing queries
  searchSuggestions(query: String!, limit: Int): [SearchSuggestion!]!
}
```

### Frontend Components
1. **useSearchSuggestions Hook**
   - Uses Apollo Client to query search suggestions
   - Implements debouncing with skip logic (minimum 2 characters)
   - Handles loading and error states

2. **Navigation Component**
   - Enhanced with search form and suggestions dropdown
   - Responsive design for both desktop and mobile views
   - Click-outside detection for dropdown closure
   - Form submission handling for search queries

## Files Modified/Added
1. `services/product-catalog/graphql/schema.graphql` - Added search suggestions schema
2. `services/product-catalog/models/models.go` - Added SearchSuggestion model
3. `services/product-catalog/graphql/schema.resolvers.go` - Added searchSuggestions resolver
4. `storefront/src/hooks/useSearchSuggestions.ts` - New custom hook
5. `storefront/src/components/Navigation.tsx` - Enhanced with autocomplete
6. `storefront/src/graphql/queries.ts` - Added GET_SEARCH_SUGGESTIONS query

## Next Steps
1. Regenerate GraphQL code for the product catalog service
2. Implement the searchSuggestions resolver logic in the product catalog service
3. Test the end-to-end search functionality
4. Optimize search performance with caching
5. Add search analytics tracking

## Testing
The search enhancements have been implemented but require backend resolver implementation to function fully. Once the backend is complete, testing should include:
- Verifying search suggestions appear as users type
- Checking that suggestions are relevant to the search query
- Testing both desktop and mobile search experiences
- Validating search submission functionality
- Ensuring proper error handling
