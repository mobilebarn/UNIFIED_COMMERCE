## Integration with Existing Services

### Product Catalog Service
```graphql
query GetProductForPOS($id: ID!) {
  product(id: $id) {
    id
    title
    handle
    variants {
      id
      title
      price
      inventoryQuantity
      barcode
    }
    images {
      src
    }
  }
}
```

### Inventory Service
```graphql
mutation AdjustInventory($input: InventoryAdjustmentInput!) {
  adjustInventory(input: $input) {
    productId
    variantId
    quantity
    locationId
    timestamp
  }
}
```

### Order Service
```graphql
mutation CreateOrder($input: CreateOrderInput!) {
  createOrder(input: $input) {
    id
    orderNumber
    status
    totalPrice
    lineItems {
      id
      name
      quantity
      price
    }
  }
}
```

### Payment Service
```graphql
mutation ProcessPayment($input: ProcessPaymentInput!) {
  processPayment(input: $input) {
    id
    amount
    status
    paymentMethod
    transactionId
  }
}
```

## Offline Capabilities

### Local Data Storage
- SQLite database for offline operations
- Sync queue for pending transactions
- Conflict resolution strategies

### Offline Workflows
1. **Product Lookup**: Cache frequently accessed products
2. **Order Creation**: Store orders locally until connectivity restored
3. **Payment Processing**: Queue payments for processing when online
4. **Inventory Adjustments**: Track changes locally, sync when possible

## Security Considerations

### PCI Compliance
- Stripe Terminal handles card data securely
- End-to-end encryption for all sensitive data
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
