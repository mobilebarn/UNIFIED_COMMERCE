## ðŸŽ‰ What We've Built

We have successfully created a complete Retail OS platform with:

1. **8 Microservices** - Each handling a specific business domain:
   - Identity Service (Authentication & Authorization)
   - Cart Service (Shopping Cart Management)
   - Order Service (Order Processing)
   - Payment Service (Payment Processing)
   - Inventory Service (Inventory Management)
   - Product Catalog Service (Product Management)
   - Promotions Service (Discounts & Promotions)
   - Merchant Account Service (Merchant Profiles)

2. **GraphQL Federation Gateway** - Unifying all services into a single API endpoint with cross-service relationships

3. **Admin Panel** - A React-based merchant dashboard for business management with real data

4. **Storefront** - A Next.js e-commerce frontend with real product data

5. **Infrastructure** - Dockerized services with PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, and Kafka
