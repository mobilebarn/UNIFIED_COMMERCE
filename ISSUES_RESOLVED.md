# RETAIL OS - ISSUES RESOLVED

## üìÖ Date: September 6, 2025

## üéØ Summary

This document summarizes all the issues we've identified and resolved during the Retail OS platform development, as well as the current issues we're working on.

## ‚úÖ Issues Resolved

### 1. Inventory Service GraphQL Schema Error
**Problem:** Undefined @shareable directive in schema.graphql
**Error Message:** "schema.graphql:148:86: Undefined directive shareable"
**Root Cause:** Federation v2 schema extension was not properly defined
**Solution:**
- Updated schema.graphql to include proper federation v2 schema extension:
  ```graphql
  extend schema @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0", import: ["@key", "@external", "@requires", "@provides", "@shareable"])
  ```
- Added missing federation directives to Address type:
  ```graphql
  type Address @key(fields: "firstName lastName address1 address2 city province country zip") @goModel(model: "unified-commerce/services/inventory/models.Address") @shareable
  ```
- Regenerated GraphQL code with `go run github.com/99designs/gqlgen generate`

### 2. Location Resolver Type Mismatch
**Problem:** locationResolver.UpdatedAt was returning (*string, error) but interface expected (string, error)
**Root Cause:** Resolver function signature didn't match generated interface
**Solution:**
- Modified the resolver to return string directly:
  ```go
  func (r *locationResolver) UpdatedAt(ctx context.Context, obj *models.Location) (string, error) {
      updatedAtStr := obj.UpdatedAt.Format(time.RFC3339)
      return updatedAtStr, nil
  }
  ```

### 3. GraphQL Federation Composition Errors - Address Type Inconsistencies
**Problem:** Inconsistent Address type definitions across services causing composition failures
**Root Cause:** Different services had different field definitions for the Address type
**Solution:**
- Created unified Address type with all fields from all services:
  ```graphql
  type Address @key(fields: "firstName lastName address1 address2 city province country zip") @shareable {
    firstName: String
    lastName: String
    company: String
    address1: String
    address2: String
    city: String
    province: String
    country: String
    zip: String
    phone: String
    latitude: Float
    longitude: Float
  }
  ```
- Updated all service schemas to use consistent Address type
- Ensured all AddressInput types include all fields

### 4. Duplicate Address Model Definition
**Problem:** "Address redeclared in this block" when building payment service
**Root Cause:** Duplicate Address definition at end of models.go file
**Solution:**
- Removed duplicate Address definition from payment service models.go
- Kept only one Address model definition

### 5. Transaction Type Conflicts
**Problem:** Transaction type existed in order service but not payment service, causing composition errors
**Root Cause:** Both services defined Transaction types, creating conflicts in federation
**Solution:**
- Removed Transaction type from order service schema
- Removed transactions field from Order type
- Ensured Transaction type is managed by payment service only

### 6. Payment Service Address Model Issues
**Problem:** Payment service Address model missing latitude/longitude fields
**Root Cause:** Inconsistent model definitions between services
**Solution:**
- Updated payment service Address model to include latitude/longitude fields
- Ensured consistency with other services

### 7. Order Service Schema Corruption
**Problem:** Schema corruption in Order service causing compilation errors
**Root Cause:** Manual edits and conflicting type definitions
**Solution:**
- Created clean minimal schema
- Removed conflicting Transaction type
- Regenerated GraphQL code

### 8. Payment Service Schema Corruption
**Problem:** Schema corruption in Payment service causing compilation errors
**Root Cause:** Manual edits and conflicting type definitions
**Solution:**
- Created clean minimal schema
- Verified type definitions
- Regenerated GraphQL code

### 9. Federation v2 Directive Issues - RESOLVED ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Payment service schema was missing Federation v2 directives
**Root Cause:** Commented out Federation v2 directive in schema.graphql
**Solution:**
- Uncommented the Federation v2 directive:
  ```graphql
  extend schema
    @link(url: "https://specs.apollo.dev/federation/v2.0", import: ["@key", "@external", "@requires", "@provides", "@shareable"])
  ```
- Verified all services use Federation v2 specification

### 10. Field Name Inconsistencies - RESOLVED ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Order and Payment services using different field names for Address type
**Root Cause:** Some services used old field names (address1, address2, province, zip) while others used new names (street1, street2, state, postalCode)
**Solution:**
- Updated Order service Address model to use new field names
- Updated Payment service Address model to use new field names
- Standardized on field names: street1, street2, state, postalCode

### 11. GraphQL Federation Gateway Composition Errors - RESOLVED ‚úÖ
**Problem:** Gateway fails to compose schema due to remaining type inconsistencies
**Root Cause:** Various schema conflicts and missing directives
**Solution:**
- ‚úÖ Fixed Address type inconsistencies
- ‚úÖ Removed Transaction type conflicts
- ‚úÖ Standardized shared types
- ‚úÖ Fixed missing @key directives
- ‚úÖ Tested unified schema composition
- ‚úÖ **ALL 8 SERVICES NOW SUCCESSFULLY CONNECTED TO FEDERATION GATEWAY**
