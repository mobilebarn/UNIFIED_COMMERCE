# UNIFIED COMMERCE - TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

## üìã Current Status Overview

As of September 1, 2025, the Unified Commerce platform has the following status:

- ‚úÖ All 8 microservices have complete codebases
- ‚úÖ GraphQL Federation Gateway code is implemented
- ‚ùå Infrastructure services (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, Kafka) are not running
- ‚ùå No microservices are currently operational
- ‚ùå GraphQL Federation Gateway is not operational
- ‚ùå Admin panel is not connected to backend services

## üö® Critical Issues Identified

### 1. Infrastructure Services Not Running
**Problem:** Docker containers for databases and messaging systems are not started
**Impact:** All microservices fail to start due to missing database connections
**Solution:** Start Docker infrastructure services

### 2. GraphQL Schema Composition Errors
**Problem:** Federation gateway fails to compose schema due to:
- Inconsistent Address type definitions across services
- Missing @key directives on shared types
- Transaction type conflicts between order and payment services
**Impact:** GraphQL Federation Gateway cannot start
**Solution:** Standardize shared types and fix federation directives

### 3. Order/Payment Service Compilation Issues
**Problem:** Manual edits to GraphQL schemas have created compilation errors
**Impact:** Services may not build or run correctly
**Solution:** Fix resolver type mismatches and regenerate GraphQL code

## üîß Step-by-Step Troubleshooting

### Step 1: Start Infrastructure Services

```powershell
# Navigate to project root
cd c:\Users\dane\OneDrive\Desktop\UNIFIED_COMMERCE

# Start all infrastructure services
docker-compose up -d

# Verify services are running
docker ps
```

**Expected Output:**
- PostgreSQL container running on port 5432
- MongoDB container running on port 27017
- Redis container running on port 6379
- Kafka container running on port 9092

### Step 2: Verify Database Connectivity

```powershell
# Test PostgreSQL connection
docker exec -it unified-commerce-postgres psql -U postgres -c "\l"

# Test MongoDB connection
docker exec -it unified-commerce-mongodb mongosh --eval "db.adminCommand('ismaster')"

# Test Redis connection
docker exec -it unified-commerce-redis redis-cli ping
```

### Step 3: Build All Services

```powershell
# Build each service to verify no compilation errors
$services = @("identity", "cart", "order", "payment", "inventory", "product-catalog", "promotions", "merchant-account")

foreach ($service in $services) {
    Write-Host "Building $service service..."
    cd "services/$service"
    go build ./cmd/server
    if ($LASTEXITCODE -eq 0) {
        Write-Host "‚úÖ $service built successfully"
    } else {
        Write-Host "‚ùå $service build failed"
    }
    cd ../..
}
```

### Step 4: Fix GraphQL Federation Issues

#### 4.1 Fix Address Type Inconsistencies

Ensure all services have consistent Address type definitions with proper @key directives:

```graphql
type Address @key(fields: "firstName lastName address1 address2 city province country zip") @shareable {
  firstName: String
  lastName: String
  company: String
  address1: String
  address2: String
  city: String
  province: String
  country: String
  zip: String
  phone: String
  latitude: Float
  longitude: Float
}
```

#### 4.2 Remove Transaction Type Conflicts

Remove Transaction type from order service since it should be managed by payment service:

1. Remove the Transaction type definition from `services/order/graphql/schema.graphql`
2. Remove the transactions field from the Order type
3. Regenerate GraphQL code: `go run github.com/99designs/gqlgen generate`

#### 4.3 Add Missing Federation Directives

If federation directives are not recognized, add them directly to schema files:

```graphql
# Federation directives
directive @key(fields: String!) on OBJECT | INTERFACE
directive @external on FIELD_DEFINITION
directive @requires(fields: String!) on FIELD_DEFINITION
directive @provides(fields: String!) on FIELD_DEFINITION
directive @link(url: String!, import: [String!]) on SCHEMA
directive @shareable on OBJECT | FIELD_DEFINITION
```

### Step 5: Start Services Individually

```powershell
# Start each service with proper environment
$services = @(
    @{name="identity"; port=8001},
    @{name="cart"; port=8002},
    @{name="order"; port=8003},
    @{name="payment"; port=8004},
    @{name="inventory"; port=8005},
    @{name="product-catalog"; port=8006},
    @{name="promotions"; port=8007},
    @{name="merchant-account"; port=8008}
)

foreach ($service in $services) {
    Write-Host "Starting $($service.name) service on port $($service.port)..."
    cd "services/$($service.name)"
    # Load environment variables from .env file
    Get-Content .env | ForEach-Object {
        if ($_ -and $_ -notmatch '^#') {
            $name, $value = $_ -split '=', 2
            if ($name -and $value) {
                [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable($name.Trim(), $value.Trim())
            }
        }
    }
    # Start service
    go run ./cmd/server/main.go &
    Start-Sleep -Seconds 3
    cd ../..
}
```

### Step 6: Verify Service Health

```powershell
# Check if services are responding
$ports = @(8001, 8002, 8003, 8004, 8005, 8006, 8007, 8008)

foreach ($port in $ports) {
    try {
        $response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:$port/health" -TimeoutSec 5
        Write-Host "‚úÖ Service on port $port is responding"
    } catch {
        Write-Host "‚ùå Service on port $port is not responding"
    }
}
```

### Step 7: Start GraphQL Federation Gateway

```powershell
cd gateway

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Start Apollo Federation Gateway
npm start
```
