# Deals Page Enhancement with Real Promotional Data

## Overview
This document summarizes the enhancement of the deals page to use real promotional data from the GraphQL API instead of mock data. The implementation connects the storefront to the Promotions Service through the GraphQL Federation Gateway.

## Changes Made

### 1. GraphQL Schema Updates
Added new interfaces and queries to the storefront GraphQL queries file:
- `Promotion` interface for promotion data structure
- `DiscountCode` interface for discount code data structure
- `Campaign` interface for campaign data structure
- `GET_ACTIVE_PROMOTIONS` query to fetch active promotions
- `GET_CAMPAIGNS` query to fetch promotional campaigns

### 2. Deals Page Implementation
Enhanced the deals page (`/deals`) with real GraphQL data:

#### Data Fetching
- Integrated `useQuery` hooks to fetch data from GraphQL
- Added queries for active promotions, campaigns, and products
- Implemented proper loading and error states

#### Active Promotions Section
- Displays current active promotions from the Promotions Service
- Shows promotion details including name, description, discount value, and validity period
- Includes visual indicators for discount percentages

#### Campaigns Section
- Displays promotional campaigns with their details
- Shows campaign period, budget, and description
- Provides call-to-action buttons to explore campaigns

#### Countdown Timer
- Maintained the countdown timer functionality
- Added proper formatting for time values
- Implemented automatic reset when timer reaches zero

#### Product Deals
- Enhanced product display with real data from the Product Catalog Service
- Maintained discount percentage indicators
- Kept existing ProductCard component integration

## Technical Details

### GraphQL Queries
The implementation uses the following GraphQL queries:

```graphql
query GetActivePromotions($merchantId: ID!) {
  activePromotions(merchantId: $merchantId) {
    id
    name
    description
    type
    status
    discountType
    discountValue
    startDate
    endDate
    applicableProducts
    applicableCollections
    applicableCustomers
    priority
    usageLimit
    usedCount
    createdAt
    updatedAt
  }
}

query GetCampaigns($filter: CampaignFilter) {
  campaigns(filter: $filter) {
    id
    merchantId
    name
    description
    type
    status
    startDate
    endDate
    budget
    goalType
    goalValue
    createdAt
    updatedAt
    promotions {
      id
      name
      description
      type
      status
      discountType
      discountValue
      startDate
      endDate
    }
  }
}
```

### Data Flow
1. Deals page mounts and triggers GraphQL queries
2. Apollo Client fetches data from the GraphQL Federation Gateway
3. Gateway aggregates data from the Promotions Service and Product Catalog Service
4. Data is processed and displayed in the UI
5. Countdown timer updates in real-time using useEffect

## Future Enhancements
1. Implement more sophisticated promotion-to-product mapping
2. Add filtering and sorting capabilities for promotions
3. Implement personalized deals based on user preferences
4. Add analytics tracking for promotion performance
5. Enhance mobile responsiveness for promotion cards
6. Implement real-time updates for promotion status changes

## Testing
The implementation has been tested with:
- Successful data fetching from GraphQL
- Loading and error state handling
- Countdown timer functionality
- Responsive layout across different screen sizes
- Integration with existing ProductCard component

## Deployment
The changes are ready for deployment and require no additional backend changes since the Promotions Service is already integrated with the GraphQL Federation Gateway.
