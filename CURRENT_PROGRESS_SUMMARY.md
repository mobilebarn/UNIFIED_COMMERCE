## ‚è≥ Current Status

### GraphQL Federation Gateway
**Status:** PARTIALLY COMPLETE ‚è≥
**Description:** 3 of 8 services successfully connected to the GraphQL Federation Gateway
**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ Unified GraphQL endpoint for connected services
- ‚úÖ Cross-service relationships (among connected services)
- ‚úÖ Entity resolution across connected services
- ‚úÖ Proper error handling
- ‚úÖ Health check endpoint at `/health`
- ‚úÖ GraphQL Playground available at `/graphql`

### Service Integration
**Status:** PARTIALLY COMPLETE ‚è≥
**Description:** 3 of 8 services start successfully and communicate properly
**Progress:**
- ‚úÖ All services building successfully
- ‚è≥ 3 services responding to health checks (37.5%)
- ‚úÖ Cross-service communication verified (among connected services)

### Admin Panel Connection
**Status:** INCOMPLETE ‚ùå
**Description:** Admin panel not yet connected to the GraphQL Federation Gateway
**Progress:**
- ‚úÖ Admin panel UI complete
- ‚úÖ Authentication UI implemented
- ‚ùå API endpoints not yet updated to use GraphQL Gateway
- ‚ùå Real data not yet replacing mock data
- ‚ùå Admin panel not yet running on http://localhost:5173/

## üîß Technical Issues Identified

### 1. Port Conflicts - NEEDS RESOLUTION ‚ùå
**Problem:** Services failing to start due to port binding errors
**Error Messages:** 
- "listen tcp :8005: bind: Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port) is normally permitted."
- "listen tcp :8003: bind: Only one usage of each socket address (protocol/network address/port)."
**Root Cause:** Duplicate service instances already running on ports
**Solution Needed:**
- Identify and stop duplicate service instances
- Ensure each service runs on its designated port only

### 2. Missing Services - NEEDS RESOLUTION ‚ùå
**Problem:** 5 of 8 services not responding to health checks
**Affected Services:**
- Identity Service (8001)
- Cart Service (8002)
- Product Catalog Service (8006)
- Promotions Service (8007)
- Merchant Account Service (8008)
**Root Cause:** Services not started or failing to start
**Solution Needed:**
- Start missing services
- Verify health check endpoints respond

## üìã Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Resolve Port Conflicts (1-2 hours)
- Identify and stop duplicate service instances
- Ensure each service runs on its designated port only

### 2. Start Missing Services (2-3 hours)
- Start Identity Service (8001)
- Start Cart Service (8002)
- Start Product Catalog Service (8006)
- Start Promotions Service (8007)
- Start Merchant Account Service (8008)

### 3. Connect All Services to Gateway (1-2 hours)
- Update gateway configuration to include all services
- Verify all 8 services introspected
- Test cross-service queries across all services

### 4. Connect Admin Panel (2-3 hours)
- Update Apollo Client configuration to connect to GraphQL Gateway
- Replace mock data with real GraphQL queries
- Implement authentication flow with real backend
