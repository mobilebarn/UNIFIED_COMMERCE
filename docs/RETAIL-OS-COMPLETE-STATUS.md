## 🚀 **Immediate Next Steps**

### **Step 1: Generate Railway Domain (IN PROGRESS)**
Based on your screenshot, you need to:
1. ✅ Set port to **8080** (as shown in your Railway dashboard)
2. ✅ Click **"Generate Domain"**
3. ✅ Copy the generated gateway URL

### **Step 2: Configure Gateway Environment Variables**
Use the automated tool I created:
- 📁 **File**: `scripts/railway-env-generator.html`
- **Action**: Open in browser, paste any Railway service URL, generate all variables
- **Target**: Railway Gateway service → Variables tab

### **Step 3: Final Deployment Test**
- Verify all 8 services connect successfully
- Test unified GraphQL endpoint
- Confirm frontend apps can connect
