# Alternative Deployment - Netlify Drop

## Quick Fix: Deploy to Netlify (5 minutes)

1. **Build the static site locally**:
   ```bash
   cd storefront
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Upload to Netlify**:
   - Go to [netlify.com/drop](https://netlify.com/drop)
   - Drag and drop the entire `out` or `dist` folder
   - Get instant live URL

## Alternative: Use Surge.sh (2 minutes)

1. **Install Surge**:
   ```bash
   npm install -g surge
   ```

2. **Deploy**:
   ```bash
   cd storefront
   npm run build
   surge ./out retail-os-storefront.surge.sh
   ```

## Alternative: GitHub Pages (5 minutes)

1. **Enable GitHub Pages** in repo settings
2. **Push to gh-pages branch**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   git checkout -b gh-pages
   git add out/
   git commit -m \"Deploy storefront\"
   git push origin gh-pages
   ```

## Why Vercel is Failing

The issue is that Vercel is:
1. **Not detecting the storefront subdirectory properly**
2. **Using old build configuration**
3. **Missing the latest commits in deployment**

These alternative platforms will work immediately with the static export.
