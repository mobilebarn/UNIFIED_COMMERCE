# RETAIL OS RAILWAY DEPLOYMENT PROGRESS MONITOR
# Use this checklist to track deployment progress

## üîç MONITORING CHECKLIST

### Phase 1: Check Service Status (Next 5 minutes)
Look at your Railway dashboard and check each service:

**‚úÖ WORKING SERVICES (should show green/deployed):**
- [ ] retail-os-inventory (was "Initializing" - should be done now)
- [ ] MongoDB (database - should be green)
- [ ] Postgres (database - should be green) 
- [ ] Redis (database - should be green)

**‚è≥ SERVICES TO FIX (add environment variables):**
- [ ] retail-os-cart
- [ ] retail-os-merchant
- [ ] retail-os-payment
- [ ] retail-os-product
- [ ] retail-os-analytics
- [ ] retail-os-order
- [ ] retail-os-identity
- [ ] retail-os-promotions
- [ ] retail-os-gateway

### Phase 2: Apply Fixes (For each failed service)
For EACH service marked with ‚ùå or "Failed":

1. **Click on the service name**
2. **Go to: Settings ‚Üí Variables**
3. **Add these two variables:**
   ```
   RAILWAY_DOCKERFILE_PATH=Dockerfile
   NIXPACKS_CONFIG_FILE=nixpacks.toml
   ```
4. **Click "Redeploy"**
5. **Mark it here:** [ ] Service name: ________________

### Phase 3: Monitor Build Progress
After adding variables and redeploying, watch for:

**GOOD SIGNS:**
- ‚úÖ Status changes from "Failed" to "Building" 
- ‚úÖ Status changes to "Deploying"
- ‚úÖ Status changes to "Deployed" (GREEN)
- ‚úÖ You see a URL for the service

**BAD SIGNS:**
- ‚ùå Status stays "Failed"
- ‚ùå New error messages in logs
- ‚ùå "Build failed" messages

## üìû REPORT BACK TO ME

Tell me:
1. **Current status numbers** (how many green/red/yellow)
2. **Any services still failing** after applying the fixes
3. **Specific error messages** if any persist
4. **Screenshots** if helpful

The nixpacks configuration I deployed should resolve all the build issues. If you're still seeing failures after applying the environment variables, let me know exactly what errors you're seeing!
