## 🚀 What Was Accomplished

### Discovery Phase
- Found that merchant-account service was missing from GraphQL Federation
- Service already had comprehensive GraphQL schema and handler
- Only missing: main.go integration and gateway configuration

### Implementation Phase  
1. **Fixed GraphQL Handler** - Updated logger imports to use shared logger
2. **Added GraphQL Route** - Integrated `/graphql` endpoint in main.go
3. **Updated Gateway** - Added merchant-account as 8th federated service
4. **Build Verification** - All services compile and build successfully

### Merchant Account GraphQL Schema Features
- **814-line comprehensive schema** with full federation support
- **Merchant Entity** - Core business accounts with relationships
- **Store Entity** - Individual store locations and channels  
- **Subscription Entity** - Business subscription plans and billing
- **Federation Extensions** - Extends User, Product, Order entities
- **Complete Type System** - Addresses, banking, members, invoices

## 🎯 Complete GraphQL Federation Architecture

### Federation Graph
```
Gateway (4000) → 8 Federated Services
├── Identity (8001)      ← Users, Auth, Roles
├── Cart (8002)          ← Shopping carts  
├── Order (8003)         ← Order processing
├── Payment (8004)       ← Payments, transactions
├── Inventory (8005)     ← Stock management
├── Product Catalog (8006) ← Products, variants
├── Promotions (8007)    ← Discounts, campaigns
└── Merchant Account (8008) ← Business accounts, stores
```

### Federation Relationships
- **User** → owns merchants, has cart, places orders
- **Merchant** → has stores, subscriptions, members  
- **Store** → contains products, manages inventory
- **Product** → tracked in inventory, added to carts
- **Order** → contains products, requires payment
- **Payment** → processed for orders, linked to merchants

    id
    email
    firstName
    lastName
    
    # From Merchant Account service
    ownedMerchants {
      id
      businessName
      status
      
      # Nested store relationships
      stores {
        id
        name
        storeType
        
        # From Product Catalog service
        products {
          id
          title
          status
          
          # From Inventory service
          inventory {
            quantity
            location
          }
        }
      }
      
      # Subscription information
      subscriptions {
        id
        status
        plan {
          displayName
          monthlyPrice
        }
      }
    }
    
    # From Cart service
    cart {
      id
      items {
        quantity
        product {
          title
          price
        }
      }
    }
    
    # From Order service
    orders {
      id
      status
      total
